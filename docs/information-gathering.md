Title : Comparison of RetinaNet, SSD, and YOLO v3
for real-time pill identifcation

- Traditional deep learning(openCV)
1. Neto et al. proposed a feature extractor based on shape and color in 1,000
images of 100 diferent classes of pills, obtaining an accuracy of over 99% using various classifers [14].

2. The best result which was obtained by binarizing the imprint’s area
with Otsu’s thresholding with noise elimination and using
trained Tesseract [8], can reach the precision and recall over
57%.

. Swastika
et  al. proposed using three LeNet or AlexNet models
to extract the three main features of pills, shape, color,
and imprint, and combined three CNNs into an integrated network for pill identifcation. Te network was
trained on 24,000 images of eight types of pill, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 99.16% [17]. 

Based on these studies, deep learning has gradually replaced
manual design extraction in pill feature extraction, and
deep learning algorithms, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and
ResNet, are able to address the problem of pill image
classifcation

but they have not been applied to pill identifcation. 
In addition, in practical applications, especially in places with high workloads such as pharmacies, 
there is a need to consider accuracy while also focusing on preforming the task in
real-time. To the best of our knowledge, existing studies do not take real-time performance into account.

A study [19] in 2017 showed that
RetinaNet could achieve detection speeds similar to
some one-stage algorithms, and the detection accuracy
exceeded many two-stage algorithms at that time.
